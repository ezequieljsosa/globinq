  * Run `npm install` to get the project's dependencies  
  * Run `./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` (`npm run build` no longer works)
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change.
  * Run `npm run test`
